# molimm_employee_engagement_plan

My notes and suggestions for a MOLIMM employee engagement plan.

## Bigger context

Employee engagement is reportedly low, especially among PhD students.
High employee engagement is an important factor for employee well-being
and productivity.

## Informally done right already

 * PI always ask employee's for compliments, complaints, feedback 
   at the end of every meeting
 * PI's office is always open for employees to walk in
 * PI listens to employees, 
   employees are observably influential in the group weekly schedule

## Informally overlooked things

 * Thinking 'I (the PI) do a great job already' may 
   not be shared by the employees
 * The employees may feel engaged with the group, 
   but not with the university

## Opportunities

 * Measure the employee engagement, separated by level, i.e. MOLIMM and RuG. 
 * Prove that MOLIMM does an awesome job, by doing an anonymous survey,
   held among and organized by the postdocs/PhDs. Do this every half year.
   Publish the results om a website, regardless of the findings. Prove that
   there is improvement or a stable high level to the group. 
   Show that plot as well! Seperarate this for MOLIMM and Rug
