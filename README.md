## Survey

```
These are just ideas for now
```

@richelbilderbeek: I propose to use exactly the same questions as the RuG survey,
split up in two levels, MOLIMM and RuG. In this way, we can measure if
MOLIMM employee engagement is significantly higher than towards the RuG.

Additionally, I suggest to add more open questions, such as to give suggestions. 
In this way, we can already engage our colleagues in loving our group even more.

## Older notes

### Bigger context

Employee engagement is reportedly low, especially among PhD students.
High employee engagement is an important factor for employee well-being
and productivity.

### Informally done right already

 * PI always ask employee's for compliments, complaints, feedback 
   at the end of every meeting
 * PI's office is always open for employees to walk in
 * PI listens to employees, 
   employees are observably influential in the group weekly schedule

### Informally overlooked things

 * Thinking 'I (the PI) do a great job already' may 
   not be shared by the employees
 * The employees may feel engaged with the group, 
   but not with the university

### Opportunities

 * Measure the employee engagement, separated by level, i.e. MOLIMM and RuG. 
 * Prove that MOLIMM does an awesome job, by doing an anonymous survey,
   held among and organized by the postdocs/PhDs. Do this every half year.
   Publish the results om a website, regardless of the findings. Prove that
   there is improvement or a stable high level to the group. 
   Show that plot as well! Seperarate this for MOLIMM and Rug
